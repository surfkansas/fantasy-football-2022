# Fantasy Football 2022 Data

The historical data here has been scraped from https://www.footballdb.com and contains regular season data data from 2012 to 2021.

The raw data in is the `/data/raw` folder, broken down by position, year, and week.

A merged CSV file is available in `/data/merged_csv/ff.csv`.

An feather-formatted file is available in `/data/merged_feather/ff.feather`.

Should you use this data set for your Fantasy Football league? Probably not. I'm actually just setting this up to do some learning with data modeling. I will probably loose my league, so be warned.
